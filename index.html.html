    <div class="body">
    <h1><u>Introduction</u>:</h1>
    <p>Rainwater harvesting is the simple process or technology used to conserve rainwater by collecting, storing, conveying and purifying of rainwater that runs off from rooftops, parks, roads, open grounds, etc. for later use. Here, let us have a look at the diagram of rainwater harvesting system.</p>

    <p>All living things including plants, animals and human beings need water to live and to carry out different cellular activities.</p>
    <p>Water is a precious, essential and an abiotic component of the ecosystem. Today we all are heading toward the scarcity of water, and this is mainly because of the lack of water conservation and pollution of water bodies. So, let us not waste a drop of water and start conserving water for further use.</p>

    <u><h1>How to harvest the Rainwater?</h1></u>

    <p>Rainwater harvesting systems consists of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="disc">Catchment- Used to collect and store the captured rainwater.</li><br>        
        <li type="disc">Conveyance system – It is used to transport the harvested water from the catchment to the recharge.</li><br>       
        <li type="disc">Flush- It is used to flush out the first spell of rain.</li><br>        
        <li type="disc">Filter – Used for filtering the collected rainwater and removing pollutants.</li><br>       
        <li type="disc">Tanks and the recharge structures: Used to store the filtered water which is ready to use.</li><br>           
    </ul>
    <p>The process of rainwater harvesting involves the collection and the storage of rainwater with the help of artificially designed systems that run off naturally or man-made catchment areas like- the rooftop, compounds, rock surface, hill slopes, artificially repaired impervious or semi-pervious land surface.</p>
    <p>Several factors play a vital role in the amount of water harvested. Some of these factors are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="disc">The quantum of runoff</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Features of the catchments</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Impact on the environment</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Availability of the technology</li><br>
        <li type="disc">The capacity of the storage tanks</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h1>Why do we Harvest Rainwater?</h1>
    <figure>

    <p>The rainwater harvesting system is one of the best methods practised and followed to support the conservation of water. Today, scarcity of good quality water has become a significant cause of concern. However, rainwater, which is pure and of good quality, can be used for irrigation, washing, cleaning, bathing, cooking and also for other livestock requirements.</p>
    <u><h1>Advantages of Rainwater Harvesting</h1></u>
    <figure>
        <img src="Types-of-Rainwater-Harvesting.jpg" alt="advantages" width="500px">
        <figcaption>fig.4</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The benefits of the rainwater harvesting system are listed below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="disc">Less cost.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Helps in reducing the water bill.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Decreases the demand for water.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Reduces the need for imported water.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Promotes both water and energy conservation.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Improves the quality and quantity of groundwater.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Does not require a filtration system for landscape irrigation.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">This technology is relatively simple, easy to install and operate.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">It reduces soil erosion, stormwater runoff, flooding, and pollution of surface water with fertilizers, pesticides, metals and other sediments.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">It is an excellent source of water for landscape irrigation with no chemicals, dissolved salts and free from all minerals.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h1>Disadvantages of Rainwater Harvesting</h1>
    <p>In addition to the great advantages, the rainwater harvesting system has a few disadvantages like unpredictable rainfall, unavailability of the proper storage system, etc.</p>
    <p>Listed below are a few more disadvantages of the rainwater harvesting process.</p>
    <ul>
        <li type="disc">Regular maintenance is required.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Requires some technical skills for installation.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">Limited and no rainfall can limit the supply of rainwater.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">If not installed correctly, it may attract mosquitoes and other waterborne diseases.</li><br>
        <li type="disc">One of the significant drawbacks of the rainwater harvesting system is storage limits.</li><br>
    </ul><br>
    <u><h1>Uses of Rainwater Harvesting:</h1></u>
    <b><h1>1.Domestic use</h1></b>
    <p>Rooftop rainwater harvesting is used to provide drinking water, domestic water, water for livestock, water for small irrigation, and a way to replenish groundwater levels.</p>
    <h1><b>2.Agriculture</b></h1>

    <p>In regards to urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting in urban areas reduces the impact of runoff and flooding. The combination of urban 'green' rooftops with rainwater catchments have been found to reduce building temperatures by more than 1.3 degrees Celsius.[9] Rainwater harvesting in conjunction with urban agriculture would be a viable way to help meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for cleaner and sustainable cities, health and wellbeing, and food and water security (Sustainable Development Goal 6). The technology is available, however, it needs to be remodeled in order to use water more efficiently, especially in an urban setting.</p>
    <p>Kenya has already been successfully harvesting rainwater for toilets, laundry, and irrigation. Since the establishment of the country's 2016 Water Act, Kenya has prioritized the regulation of their agriculture industry.[10] Additionally, areas in Australia use harvested rainwater for cooking and drinking.[9] Studies done by Stout et al researching the feasibility in India found RWH was most beneficial used for small-scale irrigation, which provides income with the sales of produce, and overflow used for groundwater recharge.</p>
    <h1><b>3.Industry</b></h1>

    <p>Frankfurt Airport has the biggest rainwater harvesting system in Germany. The system helps save approximately 1 million cubic meters of water per year. The cost of the system was 1.5 million dm (US$63,000) in 1993. This system collects water from the roofs of the new terminal which has an area of 26,800 square meters. The water is collected in the basement of the airport in six tanks with a storage capacity of 100 cubic meters. The water is mainly used for toilet flushing, watering plants and cleaning the air conditioning system.</p>
    <p>Rainwater harvesting was adopted at The Velodrome – The London Olympic Park – in order to increase the sustainability of the facility. A 73% decrease in potable water demand by the park was estimated. Despite this, it was deemed that rainwater harvesting was a less efficient use of financial resources to increase sustainability than the park's blackwater recycling program.</p>
    <u><h1>Conclusion</h1></u>
    <p>The traditional rainwater harvesting structures are in need of society and these should be properly maintained and managed as these structures are environment-friendly and cost-effective. The maintaining and management of the traditional rainwater harvesting structures is very easy and even by laymen.</p>
